                    <h3><u>Craving a Little More</u></h3>
                    <p>Although Weaver’s Nuts Sweets and Snacks satisfies customer’s salty and sweet food cravings, their website did not achieve the same satisfaction. A clunky, busy website made transactions difficult and did not promote an atmosphere for customers to linger and shop. With a little restructuring and a warmer color palette the site became as inviting as their store.</p>

                   <h3><u>Wireframing for Usability</u></h3>
                    <p> Because of the principles learned  from Steve Krug’s user-minded book “Don’t Make Me Think”,  I restructured the architecture of the website's information for increased usability. Through increasing white space and including image-focused content the site's visual clutter was reduced. In the wireframing process, I implemented the ideas of reduced clutter in order to promote overall clarity for the customer’s decisions.</p>

            <h3><u>Using Figma to Solidify the Design</u></h3>
            <p>More ideas, including a smaller navbar and adding a search bar, stemmed from the wireframes and developed into the Figma files. Using the Golden Ratio to create a flexible grid, all of the new content and images were laid into place. The colors connected the customer back to Weaver’s logo and established a more branded looked.</p>

                    <h3><u>Designing for the Customer's Devices</u></h3>
                    <p>Customers access their information on a plethora of devices, so it was important to design responsively to accommodate the customer’s preference. The mobile and tablet versions of the site utilized the same hierarchy found in the desktop version, but each display as per their size.</p>
