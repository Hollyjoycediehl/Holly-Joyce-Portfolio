            <h3><u>Advocating in the Classroom</u></h3>
            <p>Inspired by my own experience with severe childhood amblyopia (a visual disorder that results in the misalignment of eyes), I wanted to research if other students with amblyopia struggled with scannable tests (Scantrons) in the classroom. Through research I soon discovered I was not alone. I dug into many academic journals that confirmed that the use of scannable answer sheets on tests placed students with amblyopia at a disadvantage as well as students with ADHD, Disagraphia, or Dyslexia. Despite the problems associated with the tests, many schools and The CollegeBoard  do not offer alternatives to students. I wanted to design a solution.</p>

            <h3><u>CREATING A TESTING COVER</u></h3>
            <p>Incorporating a built-in dyslexic reading ruler (proven to help all students read more efficiently) became my focus in creating a slidable cover for students to track their progress. It also allowed schools to use the scannable tests that they already own, while benefiting all students in the classroom by creating a cover to discourage cheating.  I created 3D models of the test cover utilizing Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

            <h3><u>Campaigning the Vision</u></h3>
            <p>Because the testing cover originated from the idea of helping students with dimmed vision, the brand earned the name “ambly” to bring awareness to the disorder. The brand fixated on the goal of helping children (specifically those with amblyopia), so the logo followed suit as a lightheartedly imperfect reminder– something that looked as though a child might be able to replicate themselves. It represents a simplified patch over an eye, which is the common treatment method for amblyopia. </p>

             <h3><u>Imagery Inclusivity</u></h3>
            <p>As a child I never saw other children wearing eyepatches depicted in images, except in a dress-up scenario or at my eye doctor's office. I wanted to normalize the common treatment method in ambly’s branding in order to boost other children’s self esteem. Content in the forms of posters, Instagram posts, and magazine spreads developed inorder to highlight statistics, raise awareness, and showcase diversity.</p>
