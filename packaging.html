                <h3><u>Packaging Remotely</u></h3>
                <p>Despite the pandemic, Wynalda Packaging in Belmont, MI kept their promise with my class to print our diecut snack packages. Wyanda sent a custom die-cut snack package  template to use as a base to design around. The coolest part of this project was that I was able to design it remotely from my laptop in PA, send it to my professor in OH, and then have the actual project printed in MI, and sent back to PA.</p>

                <h3><u>Establishing Shelf Presence</u></h3>
                    <p>After learning that we would be able to design for any packaging, I immediately gravitated towards granola. Thorough competition research revealed that many granola brands use greens, oranges, whites, and tans in their packaging. To differentiate this product from the others on the shelf, I landed on a dark brown, blush, and raspberry scheme. </p>
                    <p>Using the template provided, I assembled the sides of the box onto it and designed the box as shelf-ready as possible. My target client was a millennial lunch-packing worker, so I followed the lead of brands such as “Oatly” to inject a little humor and personality into the marketing of the box. Because of my experience as a grocery cashier at Wegmans, it was also super important to me to place the barcode at an easily scannable spot (the bottom in this case). Overall, this was such a neat process to complete and I learned a lot about a printing for packaging process.</p>
